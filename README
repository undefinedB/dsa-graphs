	The program uses my implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in C for finding the best optimal routes.
I implemented the algorithm using a min_heap data structure. How it is used:

	- it reads from stdin the input, which consists of one line with 3 numbers(vertices, edges 
	and the number of problems the program solves); it is followed by the edges(one per line)
	with the given weights
	- the firt type of task is "e1" which reads a vertex from stdin, a number n and n other 
	vertices; it outputs to stdout the shortest paths from the first vertex to the others
	- the second type of task is "e2"; this task outputs to stdout the strongly connected 
	components of the graph
	- the third type of task is "e3"; its format is similar to that of "e1", but this time 
	the program calculates the shortest route such that one can start at a given vertex, 
	goes through all of the other n vertices, and then comes back at the starting vertex.
	
	For the last task I used a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm: instead of using a
distance vector i used a two-dimensional array, in which i had the shortest distance traveled 
from the start to a set of vertices.
